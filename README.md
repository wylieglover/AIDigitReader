# AIDigitReader
Takes image input and predicts what the drawn digit is, while also reading out misclassified images

# Local Development Setup
Before starting, make sure you have at least these components installed on your computer:
- Python
- Pillow
- numpy


You'll need to run the ```load_test_digits.py``` file and that's it! Look to the console for the outputed success rate for each epoch
